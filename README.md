### _**Experiment 8: For Loop in Python**_
### _**AIM :**_
To study and implement the for loop in Python for iterating over sequences and to perform operations such as number printing, summation, matrix operations, combinations, and pattern generation.
### _**THEROY**_
- A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of values such as a list, range, or matrix.
- The loop executes the block of code once for each element in the sequence.
- The range() function is commonly used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers.
- The loop variable takes one value at a time from the sequence during each iteration.
- Nested for loops are used to work with multi-dimensional data structures such as matrices.
- for loops are widely used for mathematical computations, matrix operations, and pattern printing.
